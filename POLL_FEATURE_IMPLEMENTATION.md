# Poll Feature Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a new "Poll" game type for your Kingdom of Chaos application. This feature allows admins to create polls where participants rank each other instead of answering quiz questions. The bottom 3 participants are eliminated based on the rankings.

## What Has Been Implemented

### Backend Components

1. **New Entities**:
   - `Poll` entity (`backend/src/entities/poll.entity.ts`)
   - `PollRanking` entity (`backend/src/entities/poll-ranking.entity.ts`)

2. **New DTOs**:
   - `CreatePollDto` (`backend/src/dto/create-poll.dto.ts`)
   - `SubmitRankingsDto` (`backend/src/dto/submit-rankings.dto.ts`)

3. **New Service**:
   - `PollService` (`backend/src/services/poll.service.ts`) - Handles all poll business logic

4. **New Controller**:
   - `PollController` (`backend/src/controllers/poll.controller.ts`) - REST API endpoints

5. **Database Schema**:
   - Updated `backend/init-db.sql` with new tables for polls and poll rankings

6. **WebSocket Events**:
   - Extended `GameGateway` with poll-related events (pollActivated, pollEnded, pollRankingUpdate)

7. **Module Integration**:
   - Updated `app.module.ts` to include all new components

### Frontend Components

1. **New API Services**:
   - Added `pollApi` to `frontend/src/services/api.ts`

2. **New Types**:
   - Added Poll-related interfaces to `frontend/src/types/index.ts`

3. **Socket Integration**:
   - Extended socket service with poll events in `frontend/src/services/socket.ts`

4. **Admin Interface**:
   - Added comprehensive poll management section to `AdminPage.tsx`
   - Features: Create polls, activate polls, view active polls, end polls, delete polls

5. **Participant Interface**:
   - Created new `PollPage.tsx` component for participants to submit rankings

## Key Features

### Admin Features
- **Create Polls**: Set title, description, and time limit
- **Activate Polls**: Only one poll can be active at a time
- **Monitor Active Polls**: Real-time view of current poll status
- **End Polls**: Manually end polls before time expires
- **Delete Polls**: Remove polls from the system
- **Real-time Updates**: Socket-based notifications for poll events

### Participant Features
- **View Active Poll**: See poll details and instructions
- **Rank Participants**: Drag-and-drop style ranking of other participants
- **Cannot Rank Self**: System prevents self-ranking
- **Unique Rankings**: Each rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) can only be used once
- **Password Confirmation**: Secure submission with password verification
- **Real-time Timer**: Live countdown showing remaining time
- **Automatic Submission**: Polls end automatically when time expires

### Ranking & Elimination Logic
- Participants rank each other from 1 (best) to N (worst)
- Average rankings are calculated for each participant
- Lower average rank = better performance = higher score
- Bottom 3 participants are identified for elimination
- Points are awarded based on ranking performance (100 - average_rank * 10)

## API Endpoints

### Poll Management (Admin Only)
- `POST /api/poll/create` - Create new poll
- `POST /api/poll/activate/:id` - Activate a poll
- `GET /api/poll/all` - Get all polls (admin)
- `POST /api/poll/end/:id` - End active poll
- `POST /api/poll/delete/:id` - Delete poll

### Poll Participation
- `GET /api/poll/active` - Get active poll (public)
- `POST /api/poll/submit-rankings` - Submit participant rankings
- `GET /api/poll/results/:id` - Get poll results

## Database Tables

### polls
- `id` (UUID, primary key)
- `title` (text, required)
- `description` (text, optional)
- `is_active` (boolean)
- `time_limit` (integer, seconds)
- `poll_ends_at` (timestamp)
- `status` (pending/active/completed/cancelled)
- `created_at`, `updated_at` (timestamps)

### poll_rankings
- `id` (UUID, primary key)
- `poll_id` (UUID, foreign key to polls)
- `ranker_participant_id` (UUID, foreign key to participants)
- `ranked_participant_id` (UUID, foreign key to participants)
- `rank` (integer)
- `created_at` (timestamp)

## How to Test

### Prerequisites
1. Start the backend server
2. Start the frontend application
3. Ensure database is running with updated schema

### Testing Steps

#### As Admin:
1. Login to admin dashboard
2. Navigate to "Poll Management" section
3. Click "Create New Poll"
4. Fill in poll details (title, description, time limit)
5. Click "Create Poll"
6. Click "Activate" on the created poll
7. Monitor the active poll status
8. View real-time updates as participants submit rankings

#### As Participant:
1. Register/login as a participant
2. Navigate to the poll interface (you'll need to add routing)
3. View the active poll details
4. Rank all other participants using the dropdown selectors
5. Ensure each rank is unique (1, 2, 3, etc.)
6. Click "Submit Rankings"
7. Enter password to confirm
8. View confirmation and wait for results

### Integration Points

To fully integrate this feature, you'll need to:

1. **Add Poll Route**: Add routing in your main App.tsx to include the PollPage component
2. **Navigation**: Add navigation options for participants to access poll mode
3. **Game Mode Selection**: Allow admins to choose between "Quiz Mode" and "Poll Mode"
4. **Results Display**: Enhance the results display to show elimination information

## WebSocket Events

- `pollActivated` - Sent when admin activates a poll
- `pollEnded` - Sent when poll ends with results
- `pollRankingUpdate` - Sent when participant submits rankings (optional)

## Security Features

- Admin authentication required for poll management
- Participant password verification for ranking submission
- Prevention of self-ranking
- Validation of unique rankings
- Time-based poll expiration

## Next Steps

1. Test the implementation thoroughly
2. Add poll routing to your frontend navigation
3. Consider adding more advanced features like:
   - Poll templates
   - Different elimination rules
   - Anonymous ranking option
   - Voting history
   - Custom scoring algorithms

The poll feature is now fully implemented and ready for testing! It provides a complete alternative game mode that focuses on social dynamics and peer evaluation rather than quiz knowledge.
